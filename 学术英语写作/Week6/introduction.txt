1.1 Background of the Study

1.1.1 Importance of the Topic

In recent years, short videos have become increasingly popular among young people, especially college students. Short videos are defined as videos that are less than 10 minutes in length and are usually created and shared through social media platforms. According to a report by QuestMobile, the number of short video users in China reached 873 million in 2020, and the market size of short videos is expected to reach 157.8 billion yuan by 2022 (Xinhua, 2020).

The popularity of short videos has brought about significant changes in the way people consume and create content. Short videos have become a new form of social media, providing users with a platform to express themselves, share their experiences, and connect with others. As a result, short videos have become an essential part of the daily lives of many people, especially college students.

Understanding the usage patterns and preferences of college students regarding short videos is crucial for social media platforms, content creators, and marketers. This knowledge can help them create more engaging and relevant content, improve user experience, and increase user retention. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the current usage patterns and preferences of college students regarding short videos.

1.1.2 Necessity of the Research

Existing Problems and Literature Review

Despite the popularity of short videos among college students, there is a lack of research on their usage patterns and preferences. Most of the existing studies have focused on the impact of short videos on mental health, addiction, and academic performance (Chen et al., 2019; Lin et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2021). However, few studies have investigated the factors that influence college students' usage patterns and preferences, such as the type of content, platform, and frequency of use.

Moreover, there is a lack of research on the impact of short videos on college students' social interactions and relationships. Short videos have become a new form of social media, and they have the potential to shape the way people interact and connect with each other. Therefore, it is crucial to investigate the impact of short videos on college students' social interactions and relationships.

Gap

The existing literature has not fully explored the usage patterns and preferences of college students regarding short videos. Therefore, this study aims to fill this gap by investigating the following research questions.

1.2 Research Questions

1. What are the usage patterns of short videos among college students?
2. What are the preferences of college students regarding short videos, such as the type of content, platform, and frequency of use?
3. What is the impact of short videos on college students' social interactions and relationships?

1.3 Research Methods

This study will use a mixed-methods approach, including a survey and in-depth interviews. The survey will be conducted among college students to investigate their usage patterns and preferences regarding short videos. The survey will include questions about the type of content, platform, and frequency of use, as well as their social interactions and relationships.

The in-depth interviews will be conducted among a subset of the survey respondents to gain a deeper understanding of their experiences and perceptions of short videos. The interviews will be semi-structured and will focus on the factors that influence their usage patterns and preferences, as well as the impact of short videos on their social interactions and relationships.
